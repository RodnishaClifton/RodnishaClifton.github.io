            <p>We made this project to display how teenagers in our generation feels and what goes through their mind. The overall vision of our work is to put a box together each box have a different emotions, so therefore when you walk in you will feel however the emotion box make you feel. The experience I want the audience to have is shocked or overwhelmed away from the great and wonderful out work that have been displayed. We used photos because it capture the exact moment in the emotions. We use the questions mark format because it's so many emotions and we is asking a question which is what emotion emoji you get out of our pictures</p>
