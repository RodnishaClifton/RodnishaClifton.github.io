<p>    As a 16 year old I never thought I would make it this far, everyday I think to myself and wonder where I would be in the next 5 years will I be accomplishing my DREAM ? That dream is to become a Fashion Designer !</p>
                           
 <p>    I’ve always wanted to do something with fashion as a kid since I have a passion for fashion my goal defines me , I want to be someone who everyone looks up to. I want to be the reason why people have high self esteem , When I was 15 years old I participated in a fashion show ,that was in a building with brick walls ,chairs filling the entire place up .I was very nervous but excited at the same time that I was doing something I really love .I participated in a role of making sure the models were dressed ,their makeup was nice and also their walk . The smile on my mother's face was priceless a smile I’ve never seen on her face because she seen her daughter full of joy I knew that this was something I would love to do for the rest of my life . 
</p>       <p>   My dream is to open a business where I can show my clothes and sale others , I want to be bigger than Agaci , Forever 21 and saks fifth ave. I’m going to do everything in my power to accomplish that goal i'm gonna write a business plan, get business assistance ,try to find locations and register a business name most importantly to understand the steps on opening a business 
</p> <p> . I plan on having a unisex business that shows females and male clothing .I want to bring more money in my business by doing a unisex store.  I also want to show the world that i'm unique and very different with my designs .
